/* Coding Challenge #1

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMI's using the formula (you can even implement both 
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about 
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.


const massMark = 78; // kg
const massJohn = 92; // kg
const heightMark = 1.69; // m
const heightJohn = 1.95; // m

const bmiJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2; // m over kg
const bmiMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark); // m over kg

console.log(bmiMark, bmiJohn);
const markHigherBMI = bmiMark > bmiJohn;
console.log(massMark, heightMark, massJohn, heightJohn);
console.log('It is ' + markHigherBMI + ' that Mark has a higher BMI than John');

Coding Challenge #2 ----------
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the out puts. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

const massMark = 78; // kg
const massJohn = 92; // kg
const heightMark = 1.69; // m
const heightJohn = 1.95; // m

const bmiJohn = massJohn / heightJohn ** 2; // m over kg
const bmiMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark); // m over kg

if(bmiMark > bmiJohn) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI is higher than John's!
    Their values are:
    Mark: ${bmiMark}
    John: ${bmiJohn}`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI is higher than Mark's!
    Their values are:
    Mark: ${bmiMark}
    John: ${bmiJohn}`);
};
